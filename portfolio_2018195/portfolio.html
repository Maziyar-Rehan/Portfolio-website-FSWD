						<h2>MIAN MAZIYAR REHAN</h2>
						<p>
							I'm Maziyar and this is my Portfolio website using HTML and CSS. I'm currently 
							studying Computer Engineering at GIKI. 
							Computer Engineering involves the design and development of systems based
							on computers and complex digital logic devices. These systems find use in
							such diverse tasks as computation, communication, entertainment, information
							processing, artificial intelligence, and control. Now I would like to explain a little 
							bit about my hobbies and interests. In the world, people have many hobbies and 
							interests, being a car enthusiast is one of them. Car enthusiasts find the beauty
							in cheaper cars where they could mod their car to their desire. Travelling is my another  
							hobby. Travels and trips give me an opportunity to visit new places 
							and meet new people. I try to learn every detail about them. Travels to new places 
							sharpen our power of observation. We form in our minds a picture which may not be 
							forgotten. Travels enable us to meet new people. We get an opportunity to make new 
							friendships. We come to develop a universal outlook.
